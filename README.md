## 📚 Learning Journey

This project represents the next step in my Playwright learning journey.

In a previous project, I focused mainly on automating individual UI elements and isolated interactions.  
With this project, I am transitioning to **end-to-end (E2E) testing**, covering complete user flows such as login, data manipulation, and dynamic UI behavior.

Additionally, this project includes the integration of **Allure reporting**, allowing better visibility into test execution and results.

The main goals of this project are:

- Practice writing stable end-to-end tests
- Improve test structure using Page Object Model (POM)
- Handle dynamic elements and loading states
- Gain experience with test reporting using Allure
